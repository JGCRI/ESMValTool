# Installing ESMValTool on a Unix-Based System
[ESMValTool](https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool) is a software package that provides diagnostic and performance metrics tools for evaluating Earth system models in CMIP. This document outlines to install ESMValTool on various Unix-based systems through the command line, including the pic HPC cluster. If you aren't provided easy access to an Unix-based system, but have Windows 10, you can still run ESMValTool on your machine via the Windows 10 Linux Subsystem. 

### Installing Windows 10 Linux Subsystem
Since ESMValTool only supports Unix-based systems, you'll have to install and activate the Windows 10 Linux Subsystem on your machine, then use that to install ESMValTool. If you're using a Unix-based system, you can skip this section.

See these articles for how to install and activate the Windows 10 Linux Subsystem:
* [Windows Subsystem for Linux Installation Guide for Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
* [How to install Windows 10’s Linux Subsystem on your PC](https://www.onmsft.com/how-to/how-to-install-windows-10s-linux-subsystem-on-your-pc)

## 1. Install Conda
1. Navigate to the [Anaconda download page](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) page and select `Linux`. Right-click the appropriate download link for your system's hardware, and select `Copy link address` from the dropdown menu (see image below; I'm running 64-bit Windows so I selected `64-Bit x86 Installer`).

2. Open a Linux command prompt and enter the following:
   ```
   wget <copied-conda-url>
   ```

   This will download the conda installation `.sh` script into your current working directory on your Linux subsystem. 

3. Run the Conda installation script:
   ```
   ./Anaconda3-2019.10-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```
   An in-depth guide for installing Conda on Linux can be found [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-anaconda-on-ubuntu-18-04-quickstart).


Below is a quick walkthrough of how to create a Conda environment:
* Create a new Conda environment (see [Conda docs](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands) for more details). We'll name it `esmvaltool`:
  ```
  conda create -n esmvaltool python=3.6
  ```
  
* Activating your new `esmvaltool` Conda environment via the command line:
  ```
  conda activate esmvaltool
  ```
  
  **Note**: Normally, Conda environments are activated by the `conda activate <env>` command. However, due to extra security on pic, Conda environments in job scripts can only be activated through the `source activate <env>` command. 
  
* Deactivating your `esmvaltool` Conda environment
  ```
  conda deactivate
  ```
  
  **Note**: Unlike above, once a Conda environment is activated, it *can* be deactivated via the normal `conda deactivate` command. This command is preferred over `source deactivate`. 

## 2. Install Julia
Some ESMValTool diagnostics use [Julia](https://julialang.org), which is not currently installed as a module on pic, so we'll have to install it ourselves if we wish to run those diagnostics. If you plan on installing a version of ESMValTool that will not run Julia diagnostics, you can skip this section.

1. To download the Julia installation package, navigate to the [Julia downloads page](https://julialang.org/downloads/). Cori runs SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15, but the `Generic Linux Binaries for x86` installation package will work just fine. Right-click the link and select `copy link address` from the dropdown menu.

2. On Cori, navigate to the directory where you wish to install the Julia package (I chose `mnichol3/misc`). Download the Julia installation package from the Linux command prompt using `wget`:
   ```
   wget <copied-julia-url>
   ```
   
3. Unzip the downloaded Julia package with the following command:
   ```
   tar -xvzf julia_installation_package.tar.gz
   ```
   
4. Add Julia to your `PATH` variable. The most straight-forward way to do this is by adding Julia's `bin` directory path to your system `PATH` environment variable via your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc` file. 
  Open your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc` file in your editor-of-choice and enter the following:
    ```
    export PATH=“$PATH:/path/to/bin”
    ```
    For example, I placed my Julia package into `/global/.../mnichol3/misc`, so I added the following line to my `~/.bash_profile` file:
    ```
    export PATH=“$PATH:/global/.../mnichol3/misc/julia-1.3.1/bin”
    ```
    For other ways to add Julia to your PATH variable, see [their docs](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/).
    
5. Restart bash. This can be accomplished with the command `exec bash`. If `which julia` fails, restart your SSH session.


## 3. Install ESMValTool - Conda
Once you have Conda and Julia installed, you can install ESMValTool via the [Conda installation method](https://esmvaltool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/install.html#conda-installation).

From your Linux command prompt, activate the Conda environment you wish to install ESMValTool into.

Users have the option to install a lighter version of ESMValTool that will only run Python and NCL diagnostic scripts, removing the need to install R and Julia. This is the version I've been running with great success. To install this version, activate the Conda environment where you wish to install ESMValTool and enter the command:
```
conda install esmvaltool-python esmvaltool-ncl -c esmvalgroup -c conda-forge
```

The following command will install the full version of ESMValTool, which requires Python, R, Julia, and NCL to be installed. I've had trouble with this in the past on pic, so I don't recommend it.
```
conda install -c esmvalgroup -c conda-forge esmvaltool
```

**Note** Pic might go through a few cycles of `Solving environment` before it succeeds. 

When prompted whether or not you'd like to proceed with the installation of the Python packages, scroll up to the list of packages that will be installed and ensure the following packages are present:
```
esmvalcore
esmvaltool-ncl
esmvaltool-python
ncl
```
If they are present, press `y` to proceed with the installation.

## 4. Test your ESMValTool Installation
If ESMValTool installs into your Conda environment without error, you can do a quick check of the install with the following command:
```
esmvaltool -h
```

which should result in a message that looks like the following:
```
usage: esmvaltool [-h] [-v] [-c CONFIG_FILE] [-s]
                  [--max-datasets MAX_DATASETS] [--max-years MAX_YEARS]
                  [--skip-nonexistent]
                  [--diagnostics [DIAGNOSTICS [DIAGNOSTICS ...]]]
                  [--check-level {strict,default,relaxed,ignore}]
                  recipe

# Troubleshooting

## General Installation Failure
Due to the many moving parts and languages involved in the installation of ESMValTool, installation can faile for a number of reasons. 

For example, there could be broken Python dependencies:
```
ERROR: LoadError: Unsatisfiable requirements detected for package ArgParse [c7e460c6]:
 ArgParse [c7e460c6] log:
 ├─possible versions are: [0.6.1-0.6.2, 1.0.0-1.0.1] or uninstalled
 ├─restricted to versions 1.0.1 by an explicit requirement, leaving only versions 1.0.1
 └─restricted by compatibility requirements with RainFARM [e9a4e08f] to versions: 0.6.1-0.6.2 — no versions left
   └─RainFARM [e9a4e08f] log:
     ├─possible versions are: 1.0.1-1.0.2 or uninstalled
     └─restricted to versions * by an explicit requirement, leaving only versions 1.0.1-1.0.2
```
Failures have also been encountered in the invocation of Julia during installation.

### Solution
If you used the [Conda method](#3-install-esmvaltool---conda) of installation, try downloading the repository directly from the [ESMValTool Github](https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool) through the `git clone` command or by downloading the repo as a zip file from GitHub. 

To build and install ESMValTool from source, navigate to the root project directory (`ESMValTool/`) and create a new Conda environment from the provided `environment.yml` file:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
This command will create a new Conda environment named `esmvaltool`. Activate this new environment (`conda activate esmvaltool`) and re-try the [Conda installation method](#3-install-esmvaltool---conda).

## ESMValCore Distribution Error
Checking the ESMValTool installation (from your activated Conda env) with `esmvaltool -h` yields the following error:
```
pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'ESMValCore==2.0.0b1' distribution was not found and is required by the application
```

### Possible Causes
1. The `ESMValCore` package is not installed in your current Conda environment
2. The version of the `ESMValCore` package installed in your current environment is not compatible with your environment's version of `ESMValTool`. For example, you could have `ESMValCore v2.0.0b1` installed while the `ESMValTool` package wants `ESMValCore v2.0.0b5`. Yes, that miniscule version difference can make it break (speaking from experience).

### Solutions
1. Check that the `ESMValCore` package is installed with `conda list`. If the package is installed in your active Conda environment, the following row should appear in the list of packages:
    ```
    esmvalcore                2.0.0b5                    py_0    esmvalgroup
    ```
    If the `ESMValCore` package is not present in your environment, install it via:
    ```
    conda install -c esmvalgroup -c conda-forge esmvalcore
    ```
 2. Create a new Conda environment for `ESMValTool`. Clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool) and create a new Conda environment from the included `environment.yml` file. 
     
     From the root `ESMValTool` directory:
     ```
     conda env create --name <env_name> --file environment.yml
     ```
     Once your new environment is created, activate it and re-install `ESMValTool` via the [Conda method](#3-install-esmvaltool---conda)
